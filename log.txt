INFO:__main__:[agent1] Assistant: To efficiently organize your virtual conference, I will delegate key task groups to sub-agents for maximum efficiency and parallel execution, as these tasks require specialized tools and multi-step operations. Each sub-agent will handle a logical cluster of responsibilities:

1. **Event Scheduling & Research Sub-Agent:** Will find three suitable dates and suggest two AI keynote speakers.  
2. **Program & Platform Sub-Agent:** Will prepare a 5-session agenda and list three suitable conference platforms.  
3. **Budget & Communication Sub-Agent:** Will estimate the full event budget and draft an invitation email.

Once these results are in, I will summarize the findings and provide a recommended plan of action.

Proceeding to delegate these grouped tasks to three sub-agents.

INFO:__main__:[agent0] Assistant: To efficiently complete your multi-step virtual conference organization task, I will delegate distinct subtasks to sub-agents based on the required tools:

1. **Dates, Speakers, and Agenda:** These require specific tool access (date suggestion, speaker research, and agenda drafting). I'll create a sub-agent to handle these.
2. **Platforms, Budget, and Email Draft:** These need platform listing, budget estimation, and email drafting tools. A separate sub-agent will manage these.
3. **Summary & Recommended Plan:** IÆll consolidate and summarize all findings myself after receiving the results.

This parallel delegation ensures all steps are handled quickly and cost-effectively. Now proceeding to launch two sub-agents for the respective clusters of tasks.

**Delegation Strategy**
1. IÆll run three sub-agents in parallel for the foundational research:
   - One to find suitable dates for next month.
   - One to research and suggest AI keynote speakers.
   - One to prepare a draft agenda with five sessions.
2. Once these are ready, IÆll launch the next set of three sub-agents in parallel:
   - One to list suitable conference platforms.
   - One to estimate an event budget (using details from previous steps).
   - One to draft an invitation email for attendees.
3. Finally, IÆll summarize all findings and recommend the best plan of action.
